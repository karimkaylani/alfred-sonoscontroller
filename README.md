## Hotkeys

Hotkeys are added by adding a hotkey trigger on the workflow flowchart (open Alfred Preferences -> Workflows -> Sonos Controller, then right click in the empty space -> Triggers -> Hotkey) and connecting it to the run script block with a text argument that follows the following syntax. You can also edit the preset hotkey triggers by right clicking them and selecting configure object.

<code>(sonosName); (command)</code>

ex:

<code>Bedroom; next</code>

## Troubleshooting

If you find yourself getting the <code>No Speakers Found</code> error, it may be due to an incorrect interface address. This can be caused by having a VPN active, which unfortunatley Sonos does not support.

If you are still recieving this error, you can try manually setting the interface address to your local IP address on your machine (which can be found under your Network settings) by doing the following:

1. Open Alfred Preferences -> Workflows -> SonosController and press the [x] button in the top right corner

    This screen should appear:

2. Double click under the value column on interface_address and enter in the address of your local IP

If you have multiple households on your network (or if you have a split S1 / S2 system), got to the Workflows setting (as described above) and set the value for "multi_household" to "true".
